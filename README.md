3. Shortest Path Problem: Implement Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.

Input: Input will be from a file named graph.txt. The contents of this 
file will look similar to this example:

6
0 13 0 16 8
0 6 0 10
14 0 11
5 17
7

Output: Write to a file named result.txt
Shortest path from A to B is: 18 
Path taken: AFB

Shortest path from A to C is: 13
Path taken: AC

Shortest path from A to D is: 20
Path taken: AFED

Shortest path from A to E is: 15
Path taken: AFE

Shortest path from A to F is: 8
Path taken AF

To be graded, your program must be in your pgm and named precisely as 
6.cpp.
